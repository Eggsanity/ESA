To get started make sure you have an email address reserved solely for ESA. ESA deletes emails once it's done with them and therefore should not be used on your personal email.
Run the setup.py script with python 2.x. Enter the information it prompts you for.
Run the eslave.py file with python 2.x (Application is NOT compatible with other versions of python at this time.)
Consider setting up eslave.py to run on startup so that ESA is available whenever the device is on.
See wiki page for information on how to make further use of ESA: https://github.com/Eggsanity/ESA/wiki
